###  TEXT class for language control
###

class Text(xunicode):
    """
    A string of text (xunicode) with associated information about the language (encoding)
    that should be used for its interpretation, for example:

        HTML, SQL, URL, plain, ...

    Allows languages to be nested in one another, possibly multiple times, which yields *compound* languages:

        HTML/mediawiki, HTML/URL, SQL/HTML/plain, ...

    The Text class keeps track of language embeddings and thus enables safe, transparent and easy
    encoding/decoding/converting - to/from/between different (possibly nested) languages.
    With Text, automatic sanitization of strings can be easily implemented, especially in web applications.
    Nesting/unnesting (vertical transformations, e.g.: plain -> HTML/plain -> mediawiki/HTML/plain) is always lossless.
    Only conversions (horizontal transformations, e.g.: HTML <-> mediawiki) between languages can be lossy.

    Text instances can be manipulated with in a similar way as strings, using all common operators: + * % [].
    All operations and methods that concatenate or combine Texts, or a Text and a string, check whether the language of both operands
    is either the same or None, and propagate the language value to the resulting Text instance.
    WARNING: when using .join() method remember that you have to call it on a Text instance (!), otherwise the resulting
    string will be a plain str/unicode object, not a Text, even when joining Text instances!
    The right way to join a sequence of Text instances is the following:
        Text(sep).join(...)
    - here, the language of resulting Text instance will be derived from the language of sequence items (or None if no item has a language specified);
    or, if you want to enforce a specific language and use it as default when the sequence is empty or the items have no language, use:
        Text(sep, language).join(...)
    To make a Text instance be treated as a regular string, cast it back to unicode or str, like unicode(text).

    Example languages:
    - plain - plain text, without any encoding nor special meaning
    - HTML - rich text expressed in HTML language, a full HTML document; it can't be "decoded", because any decoding would have to be lossy
             (tags would be removed), however it might be converted to another rich-text language (wiki-text, YAML, ...),
             possibly with a loss in style information
    - HTML/plain - plain text escaped for inclusion in HTML; contains entities which must be decoded to get 'plain' text again
    - HyML/plain - plain text escaped for inclusion in HyML; contains $* escape strings which must be decoded to get 'plain' text again
    - HyML/HTML/plain - plain text encoded for HTML and later escaped for HyML; you first have to decode HyML, only then HTML,
             only then you will obtain the original string
    - URL/plain - URL-encoded plain text, for inclusion in a URL, typically as a GET parameter
    - URL - full URL of any form
    - SQL
    - value - text representation of a value
    - SQL/value - SQL representation of a value, as an escaped string that can be directly pasted into a query

    The "directory path" notation: ".../.../..." in language naming expresses the concept that when a language is nested in another language,
    it's similar to including a file inside a folder: you first have to visit the parent folder (or decode the outer language)
    in order to access the inner file (the original nested text). Also, this naming convention expresses the fact that a language
    nested in another language forms, in fact, YET ANOTHER language (!) that should have its own name (X/Y), because it has different rules
    for how a plain-text string needs to be encoded in order to form a correct representation in this language.
    For example, JavaScript code embedded in HTML's <script> block is, stricly speaking, no longer a JavaScript code!
    That's because the "</script>" substring - which normally is a valid string in JavaScript - is no longer allowed to appear
    inside this code. Thus, the true language of this piece of code is "HTML/JavaScript", rather than just "JavaScript"!
    Such intricacies are very difficult to track when implementing web applications,
    where strings in many different languages (HTML/JavaScript/CSS/SQL/URL/...) are being passed from one place to another,
    with all different types of conversions done along the way. Securing such an application and performing bullet-proof sanitization
    is close to impossible without a tool like the Text class which automatically tracks the exact language of the text
    and performs automatic conversions whenever necessary.
