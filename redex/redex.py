"""
Flexible context-based pattern matching in HTML/XML/markup/plaintext documents.

Redex Pattern is a new type of tool for extracting data from any markup document. 
It defines a new language, "redex" (REgular Document EXpressions, similarity with "regex" intentional),
for concise description of text patterns occuring in documents 
and defining which parts of text should be extracted as data during analysis.

Redex patterns define layout of the document: subsequent portions of text that must be present in given locations, 
and places where substrings - if matched - should be extracted as variables.

Redex combines consistency and compactness of regexes (single pattern matches all document 
and extracts multiple variables at once) with strength and precision of XPaths: 
it is much simpler than regexes and allows patterns to span multiple fragments of the document, 
thus providing precise *context* where each fragment is allowed to match.
Single Pattern can substitute a dozen of XPaths. Redex patterns are also much more readable than 
both regexes and XPath rules, thanks to their literal resemblance to the documents being parsed.
Pattern/redex is tailored to markup languages and is aware of characteristic parts of tagged documents,
making parsing process more reliable. Redex patterns bridge the gap between regexes and XPaths 
as used in web scraping.

Every Pattern instance is built from a string written in redex. 
This string is compiled internally to a regex and subsequently matched against documents.
For example, the following simple redex pattern:

    >>> redex = '<a href="{URL}">the link we are looking for</a>'

is compiled to a much more complicated regex:

    >>> print Pattern(redex).regex.pattern
    (|(?<=>)\s*)<a(?=\s|/|>)([^<>]*?['"\s=]|)(\s*|(['"\s=][^<>]*?['"\s=]))href\s*=\s*("|')(?P<URL>[^<>]*?)("|')(['"\s=][^<>]*?|)>the\s+link\s+we\s+are\s+looking\s+for(|(?<=>)\s*)</a(?=\s|/|>)(['"\s=][^<>]*?|)>

This regex takes care of all intricacies of HTML documents: optional spaces in different places, 
additional surrounding attributes inside tags, different equivalent quoting characters (' or ") 
for tag attribute values, etc. Nobody would be able to write this regex manually.
Redex patterns are designed to do it for you.

You can create a pattern in two ways. By instantiating Pattern class (handy for short patterns):

    >>> pat = Pattern('<a href="{URL}"></a>')
    
or by subclassing Pattern, with redex string put either in the 'pattern' property, or just in pydocs for brevity:

    class UrlPattern(Pattern):
        pattern = '<tr><td><a href="{URL}"> a long and very prominent link with <b>inner <u>elements</u></b>, enclosed in a table row </a></td></tr>'

    class UrlPattern(Pattern):
        '''
        <tr><td>
        <a href="{URL}"> a long and very prominent link with <b>inner <u>elements</u></b>, enclosed in a table row </a>
        </td></tr>
        '''
    pat2 = UrlPattern()

Typically, you match the pattern to extract some data. This can be done with any of Pattern.match*() methods:
match, match1, matchAll (see pydocs for differences between them); 
or match, match1 functions, which compile and match the pattern in one step.
They all return matched values of variables (groups):

    >>> pat.match1('<A href="http://google.com"></A>')
    'http://google.com'
    
    >>> match1('<a href="{URL}"></a>', '<A href="http://google.com"></A>')
    'http://google.com'


REDEX SYNTAX.
    
Static text        -- Regular text (static text) is matched as-is, case-insensitive by default.
                      Spaces between static words match any sequence of 1+ whitespaces.
                      Spaces surrounding non-static expressions on either side 
                      (a variable, optional expression, ...) match 0+ whitespaces (can match empty string).
                      Spaces inside <...> tags match 0+ whitespaces, as well as any sequence of chars 
                      delimited by in-tag separators: ', ", =, or a space.
                      
                      The match of the entire pattern can be preceeded in the document 
                      by any number of whitespaces (they're stripped out before matching),
                      as well as followed by any sequence of characters - not only spaces (!).
                      Effectively, the match starts at the beginning of the non-whitespace part of the document,
                      and can terminate anywhere in the doc, not necessarily at the end 
                      (doesn't have to consume all characters).
                      
                      >>> match('Alice in Wonderland', '  Alice in Wonderland -- Alice was beginning to get')
                      'Alice in Wonderland'

Apples and ~       -- Tilde (~) matches any word: a sequence of 1+ alphanumeric characters 
                      (letters, digits, underscore "_" and tilde "~"), without spaces,
                      as many characters as possible (greedy match).
                      
                      >>> match('Apples and ~', 'Apples and oranges and pears')
                      'Apples and oranges'

Version .          -- Dot (.) matches any continuous sequence of 0+ non-space characters except tags (no '>' or '<'),
                      but as few characters as possible (lazy match); can also be used inside tags.
                      If Regex.html parameter is true (default), HTML entities in the extracted text, 
                      like &amp; &quot; - are decoded automatically.
                      Put "{.}" in the pattern to match literal dot (exactly one) instead of a sequence.
                      
                      >>> match1('Python {VER .} on .', 'Python 2.7 on Linux')
                      '2.7'
                      >>> match1('<a href="./{USER ~}">', '<a href="http://twitter.com/google">')
                      'google'
                      >>> match1('"{NAME .}"', '"Johns&amp;Co."')
                      u'Johns&Co.'

Address: ..        -- Two dots (..) match any sequence of 0+ characters except tags (no '<' or '>'), lazy match; 
                      can be used inside tags, although usually a single dot '.' suffices.
                      If Regex.html parameter is true (default), the extracted text is HTML-decoded automatically,
                      that is, HTML entities get decoded (&amp; &quot; ...) and space get normalized
                      (all withspace replaced with ' ', multiple spaced merged to single space).
                      
                      >>> match1('Address: {ADDR ..} {.}', 'Address: 12-345 Warsaw, Poland.')
                      '12-345 Warsaw, Poland'
                      >>> match1('"{NAME ..}"', '"Name:   \\n   Johns&amp;Co."')
                      u'Name: Johns&Co.'

<p>...</p>         -- Three or more dots (...) match any sequence of 0+ characters, including tags 
                      ('<' and '>' allowed). Cannot be used inside tags: between < and >.
                      The dots . .. ... and the tilde ~ are called jointly the *fillers*.
                      
                      >>> match1('<p>{TEXT ...}</p>', '<p><u>Apples</u> and <i>oranges</i></p>')
                      '<u>Apples</u> and <i>oranges</i>'

<a>link</a>        -- Attributes of a tag are matched implicitly: <tag> is equivalent to <tag ..>, 
                      so there's no need to put ".." everywhere inside tags.
                      
                      >>> match1('<div>{MSG}</div>', '<div style="width:500px;border:1;" id="message">Success</div>')
                      'Success'

                      Moreover, implicit 0+ spaces are matched between neighboring tags even if no explicit
                      space is present in the pattern:
                      
                      >>> match('</td><td>', '</td>   <td>')
                      '</td>   <td>'

<div message>...   -- Each word on attribute list: attribute name, or a value surrounded by quotes, spaces or =, 
                      is treated as a separate item. Surrounding items (and entire attributes) are matched implicitly, 
                      so you can specify one item without worrying about the rest. No need to use surrounding ".." 
                      or to worry about unseen attributes and values that might be added to the tag in the future.
                      Compare this to the weirdness of the XPath expression that's needed to match just one class 
                      in a multi-class element, like "title" in class="long wide title", 
                      when the ordering of names is unknown:
                          xpath = "//div[contains(concat(' ', normalize-space(@class), ' '), ' title ')]"
                      Using redex patterns is a lot easier:
                      
                      >>> match1('<div title>{TITLE}</div>', 
                      ...        '<div style="width:800px" class="long title wide">About this website</div>')
                      'About this website'

<. price>          -- Dot (.) after '<' matches any tag name. If you don't know whether the element of interest 
                      is a <div>, or a <p>, or a <table>, or a <span>, ... or you just want to abstract from 
                      the particular name, use "<." to match any tag.
                      Note that here, the dot behaves slightly differently than the general-purpose dot used in 
                      other places: when replacing a tag name, it matches at least 1 character (no empty string), 
                      the match is greedy and it must terminate on a word boundary (space or end of tag).
                       
                      >>> match1('<. price>{PRICE}</.>', '<span class="price">$9.99</span>')
                      '$9.99'

{VAR ...}          -- Braces define a *variable*: a named subexpression, equivalent to a *group* in a regex pattern.
                      After matching, the string matched by the expression is returned under the name of the variable.
                      Definition of a variable has a form of {NAME expression}, where NAME is the variable name
                      (case-sensitive, typically in all-caps to distinguish from static parts of the pattern);
                      and 'expression' is any redex pattern, possibly containing other nested variables.
                      The 'expression' can be omitted ({NAME}), in such case the default pattern ".." is assumed.
                      By default, Pattern.match() returns an ObjDict of all variables, which is a regular dict
                      extended with object-like access to values:

                      >>> items = match('<a href="{URL ./photos/{USER ~}/{ID}/}">', 
                      ...               '<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/atelier/738724/">')
                      >>> items
                      {'URL': 'http://www.flickr.com/photos/atelier/738724/', 'USER': 'atelier', 'ID': '738724'}
                      >>> items['USER']
                      'atelier'
                      >>> items.USER
                      'atelier'
                      
                      If you want standard 'dict' to be returned instead, set dicttype=dict inside your pattern class.
                      If you wish that names of variables in the result are all changed to lowercase
                      (convenient if you want to use them as object properties later on), 
                      set tolower=True in your pattern:
                      
                      >>> pat = Pattern('{FRUIT1 ~} and {FRUIT2 ~}')
                      >>> pat.tolower = True
                      >>> items = pat.match('apples and oranges')
                      >>> items.fruit1, items.fruit2
                      ('apples', 'oranges')
                      
                      By default, all variables which do NOT contain 3-dots '...' and thus match only regular text
                      without tags, undergo HTML cleansing after extraction: striping of leading/trailing spaces,
                      merging of multiple whitespaces (incl. newlines and tabs) into a single regular space ' ',
                      and HTML entity decoding.
                      To switch this behavior off, set self.html=False in your pattern,
                      either permanently in the subclass definition or before calling Pattern.match().
                      Compare the two calls below, the 1st one executed with the default setting of html=True,
                      and the 2nd one with 'html' changed to False:
                      
                      >>> pat = Pattern('<td>{CELL}</td>')
                      >>> pat.match1('<td>  apples \\n &amp; oranges  </td>')
                      u'apples & oranges'
                      >>> pat.html = False
                      >>> pat.match1('<td>  apples \\n &amp; oranges  </td>')
                      '  apples \\n &amp; oranges  '
                      
                      However, if the variable contains 3-dots '...', no cleansing is performed 
                      regardless of 'html' setting:
                      
                      >>> match1('<tr> {ROW ...} </tr>', '<tr><td>  apples \\n &amp; oranges  </td></tr>')
                      '<td>  apples \\n &amp; oranges  </td>'

{VAR~regex}        -- If the variable name is followed immediately by a tilde (~), the remaining part 
                      of variable definition is treated as a raw regex - not redex - expression.
                      This is useful for matching arbitrary regex sub-patterns, 
                      to handle complex cases not covered by basic redex syntax.
                      Watch out: any spaces after '~' and before '}' are treated as part of the regex.
                      The regex can't contain '}' char itself, to avoid ambiguity with terminating '}'
                      (use {~regex~} syntax instead).

                      >>> match1('<a ./{ID~\d+}>', '<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/atelier/738724">')
                      '738724'

{~regex~}          -- Braces with inner tildes and an expression inside denote an unnamed regex pattern:
                      the regex is matched just like a {VAR~regex} variable, but the matched string is not extracted.
                      Enables inclusion of arbitrary regex sub-patterns in a redex pattern.
                      In contrary to {VAR~regex} syntax, here the right brace '}' is allowed inside 'regex',
                      and only a tilde-brace pair '~}' is disallowed.
                      This enables the use of {min,max} construct inside the regular expression.
                      If you want to use a regex containing '~}', split it into two separate regexes.

                      >>> match1('<a ./{ID {~\d{6}~}}>', '<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/atelier/738724">')
                      '738724'

{* expr} {+ expr}  -- Zero-or-more and one-or-more repetitions of a given redex expression 'expr'.
                      The expression can contain nested variables {* ..{X}..}, and/or hold a name itself: {*ITEM ...}.
                      In both cases, the returned value of each variable is a *list* of strings 
                      extracted by all repetitions rather than a single string.
                      
                      >>> match('{* ...<td>{ARTICLE}</td><td>{PRICE}</td>}', 
                      ...       '<tr><td>Pen</td><td>$3.50</td></tr> '
                      ...       '<tr><td>Pencil</td><td>$2.00</td></tr> '
                      ...       '<tr><td>Eraser</td><td>$1.50</td></tr> ')
                      {'ARTICLE': ['Pen', 'Pencil', 'Eraser'], 'PRICE': ['$3.50', '$2.00', '$1.50']}

{*+ ...} {++ ...}  -- You can use possessive quantifiers and atomic grouping to achieve finer control over 
{> ...}               regex backtracking and optimize the speed of regex matching. For more information, see:
                          www.regular-expressions.info/possessive.html
                          www.regular-expressions.info/atomic.html

[optional]         -- Square brackets [expr] enclose an optional expression: matched if possible,
                      but skipped if a matching - starting at the current position, where the preceeding match ended
                      - can't be found. If skipped optional expression contained variables, their values will be None.
                      Optional expressions and variables can be nested in each other.
                      
                      >>> pat = '<li> {ENTRY [<img src="{AVATAR}">] {NAME}} </li>'
                      >>> match(pat, '<li><img src="http://domain.com/john.png"> John Smith </li>')
                      {'ENTRY': '<img src="http://domain.com/john.png"> John Smith', 'AVATAR': 'http://domain.com/john.png', 'NAME': 'John Smith'}
                      >>> match(pat, '<li> Ken Edwards </li>')
                      {'ENTRY': 'Ken Edwards', 'AVATAR': None, 'NAME': 'Ken Edwards'}
                      
                      Be careful when using optional expressions. They may often exhibit unexpected behavior,
                      caused by the complex structure of backtracking during the regex matching process.
                      The possibily of finding a match depends on what preceeding string (prefix)
                      has been matched currently. Moreover, the necessity to match actual data instead of 
                      an empty string depends on what next expression follows after the optional block
                      and whether it enforces the optional to find a long match.
                      
                      Let's see an example.
                      
                      >>> match('. [tail]', "head tail")
                      ''
                      
                      Here, one might expect that the pattern would match entire "head tail" string.
                      This is not the case because the dot '.' performs a *lazy* match 
                      (matches as few characters as possible), so it first tries to match an empty string,
                      which succeeds, than matches the space ' ' to an empty string, too,
                      and only than tries to match '[tail]' to "head tail", which also succeeds (!),
                      by (unexpectedly) ignoring the optional expression in its entirety.
                      
                      To solve this problem, you can either replace the dot with a tilde, 
                      which performs a more constraint match - not only that it matches exactly one non-empty word,
                      but also the match is greedy and tries to match as many characters as possible:
                      
                      >>> match('~ [tail]', "head tail")
                      'head tail'
                      
                      Alternatively, you can move the dot and put it inside the optional expression:
                      
                      >>> match('[. tail]', "head tail")
                      'head tail'
                      
                      It is a good general rule to:
                      - use the most constrained expression that's possible in a given place, 
                        when choosing between '~', '.', '..' and '...'
                      - never put dots before optional or repeated expressions: [...], {*...},
                        but rather include them inside the expression.
                      

{.} {{} {}}        -- To match an occurence of a redex-special character, enclose it in braces;
{~} {[} {]}           a brace itself can also be enclosed:

                      >>> print match('{.} {{} {}} {~} {[} {]}', '. { } ~ [ ]')
                      . { } ~ [ ]
                      
                          
VALUE CONVERSIONS.

All extracted variables are strings by default. You can request that they are automatically casted onto other data types,
and/or their values are converted, by defining 'convert' property of the Pattern, which is a dictionary of variables names
and corresponding types/converter functions that shall be applied to extracted values before returning them to the caller.

    >>> class Pat(Pattern):
    ...     pattern = "<a {URL /comment/{USER}/{ID}}> {DATE} </a>"
    ...     convert = {'URL': url, 'USER': url_unquote, 'ID': pint, 'DATE': pdate}
    ...
    >>> Pat().match('<a href="/comment/billy%20the%20kid/34"> July 25, 2015 </a>')
    {'URL': '/comment/billy%20the%20kid/34', 'DATE': datetime.date(2015, 7, 25), 'USER': 'billy the kid', 'ID': 34}

The 'url' converter is special, because it accepts an additional parameter upon conversion: 
the URL of the page being scraped, 'baseurl', that is used for converting relative URLs in the page to absolute ones. 
When calling Pattern.match(), you can specify a 'baseurl' and it will be forwarded to all 'url' converters:

    >>> items = Pat().match('<a href="/comment/billy%20the%20kid/34"> July 25, 2015 </a>', 
    ...                     baseurl = "http://www.domain.com/home")
    >>> items['URL']
    'http://www.domain.com/comment/billy%20the%20kid/34'

None values (from optional expressions) are NOT passed through converters but returned as-is.
If a variable appears inside repeated expression, like {+ ..{NAME}..}, and multiple strings are extracted,
the converter is applied to EACH string independently rather than to a list.

Keys in 'convert' dictionary can comprise multiple names, for brevity (multi-keys). For example:
    {"PRICE CHANGE VOLUME": pdecimal}
Additionaly, keys can contain '*' wildcard to match all names of a given form, like:
    {"URL_*": url}

Standard converters provided along with Pattern include:
    url, url_unquote, pdate, pdatetime, pint, pfloat, pdecimal, percent.

You can use these ones and/or define your own. In the latter case, each converter should be a function that takes 
an extracted string and casts/converts it to a destination type/value. In 'convert' dict, you can also specify a class
instead of a function, which will instantiate objects of this class upon conversion, passing the raw value 
to this class'es __init__().

Moreover, you can use patterns as converters themselves. The inner pattern (converter) will be applied to the extracted 
string passed as an input document, and a whole dictionary (or object) of extracted values will be returned 
as a value of the variable of the outer pattern. Effectively, this mechanism allows patterns to be nested in each other.

Last but not least, you can implement custom post-processing of all extracted values at once
by overloading Pattern's 'epilog' method. This method takes a dict of extracted items after all conversions,
together with the original document, and either returns a new dict of items, or modifies the input dict in-place.
Epilog can not only change existing values, but also remove variables or add new ones to the result,
for instance, by implementing additional custom extraction based on the provided document object.
See Pattern.epilog() for details.


EMBEDDED UNIT TESTS.

Web pages evolve. Sometimes their structure changes only slightly, due to minor fixes and updates in their design,
layout or contents. Another time, the structure may get redesigned entirely from scratch.
In any case, the corresponding pattern must be updated accordingly to handle new structure.
The critical thing to watch out is whether the updated pattern still handles all special cases of 
the page's appearance - all those special cases that were carefully analysed and implemented
in the first version of the pattern, and must not get lost now, when the pattern is being updated.

In order to enable easy future verification of the pattern's behavior,
you can embed *unit tests* inside its class. 
Each test consists of a pair of class attributes named 'textX' and 'goalX',
with X being an integer (1,2,... for consecutive independent tests),
'testX' being a snippet of text that shall be used as an input document for pattern matching,
and 'goalX' being the expected output: a dictionary of extracted variables and their values.
When specifying the goal, you can use a shorthand for string-valued variables and write, for instance:
    goal1 = "NAME1 value1", "NAME2 value2", {...(remaining non-string values)...}
instead of:
    goal1 = {"NAME1": "value1", "NAME2": "value2", ...}

Whenever Python comes across a definition of a new Pattern subclass, it automatically invokes all tests 
present inside. This behavior is implemented in Pattern's custom metaclass, __Pattern__,
and is launched just after a new class is created (the class itself, not an instance!).
Upon execution, all failing tests will print detailed log to stdout. Successful tests will stay quiet.

If a given test doesn't have a goal defined (the attribute 'goalX' is missing),
the extracted dictionary of values is printed to stdout instead of being passed to verification.
Moreover, it is printed in a form suitable for direct inclusion in corresponding goalX.
Thus, when writing a new test, you can first: write testN without goalN, to see what output is produced 
by the pattern; verify manually that the output is correct; and only then copy-paste it as goalN = ...,
to keep a record for future reference when the pattern needs to be updated.
   
If you want to switch off the tests, set autotest=False inside a given Pattern subclass,
or Pattern.autotest=False to change global behavior.


PRACTICAL GUIDELINES.

When implementing redex patterns, it is helpful to understand what functional types of expressions can occur in them:
 * STATIC EXPRESSION - Any expression that behaves similarly to static text, in that it obligatory matches 
                       a non-empty string. Static expression may contain variables and tildes ~, 
                       but not optional blocks [], repetitions {* } {+ } or lazy fillers (dots, explicit or implicit).
                       Static expressions serve as pillars that support correct specification of all parts of the pattern
                       and improve speed of pattern matching.
 * REFERENCE POINTS  - Static expressions located outside optional blocks, in different places of the pattern. 
                       They help position optional subpatterns relative to other parts of the document and ensure 
                       global consistency of the pattern.
 * GUARDS            - Static expressions that surround a variable, like "<td>" and "</td>" in "<td>{DATA}</td>". 
                       They position the variable precisely in relation to neighboring text and protect 
                       against *over-matching*.
 * CLOSING ANCHOR    - Static expression inside optional block, located at its end, like "</p>" in: "[... </p>]".
                       Enforces maximum match of the inner pattern of optional block and protects against *under-matching* 
                       of variables and fillers contained inside [].

When devising a redex pattern, it is best to start with a real snippet of HTML code extracted from the actual document
to be parsed, and then convert it step by step to a redex pattern, by removing unnecessary parts, 
inserting fillers and optionality markers, reducing repeated subexpressions to {* } or {+ } blocks,
and replacing meaningful parts with variables.
Usually, pattern matching is applied to a specific node in HTML syntax tree of the document,
thus it is easiest to extract the snippet with tools like FireBug, by visually selecting the page block to be processed,
and then copy-pasting all its raw HTML contents.

A typical procedure for converting HTML snippet to a redex may look like this:
 - In the snippet, replace all occurences of values to be extracted with {NAME} or {NAME subpattern} or {*NAME ...}.
   Put explicit 3-dots '...' inside {} wherever text containing tags must be matched 
   (2-dots '..' are put by default when no sub-pattern is given).
 - Remove unnecessary parts of text by replacing them with ~ (word) or . (non-space sequence) 
   or .. (non-tag sequence) or ... (any sequence):
   - tagged parts of the document replace with ... (matches all chars, including tags)
   - untagged text between tags replace with .. (matches all chars except <>)
   - sequence of non-space chars replace with . (matches all except <> and spaces)
   - regular words comprising only alpha-numeric characters replace with ~ 
   - tag attributes list inside <> replace with a space, or ., or .., or nothing (the latter works best in many cases)
   - tag name inside <> replace with a dot '.'
   Ensure that every variable {} is still surrounded by enough amount of static text (GUARDS / REFERENCE POINTS) 
   to uniquely identify its location in the document.
 - Insert a space wherever 1+ spaces may occur in the document between remaining static parts.
   Neighboring tags don't need a space: whitespaces between > and < are matched implicitly.
 - Mark non-obligatory parts of the pattern by surrounding them with []. If the part starts with . or .. or ..., 
   include them inside [] if only possible (do this even if the optional block is the 1st sub-expression of the pattern).
   Remember to put a CLOSING ANCHOR at the end of [], to avoid under-matching of the optional block.
 - If pattern matching works too slow - which may happen particularly on negative examples, due to more laborious 
   regex backtracking needed to check all possible matchings paths - add more REFERENCE POINTS.
   If the problem persists (rare case), try to manually limit backtracking by applying atomic grouping {>...}
   or possessive quantifiers {*+ }, {++ } - but note that these constructs change semantics of the pattern,
   so you should use them with care, only when you are certain that they don't break the pattern.
 
Tips & tricks:
 - Most of the time, pattern matching is LAZY: it matches as few characters as possible, 
   and quite often an empty string turns out to be a correct match.
   This happens not only with entire pattern, but also with its sub-expressions, esp. when [...] is used.
   Thus, you should always put GUARDS at the end of (sub)expressions: static pieces of text 
   or other obligatory expressions that would force the preceding expression to match as much as possible,
   until the guard is matched, too. Without guards, you may encounter unexpected behavior: 
   the pattern can miss parts of the document despite they ARE present there.
 - When extracting URLs or their portions, ALWAYS use url() or url_unquote() converters, 
   to ensure proper unquoting of extracted strings and convert relative URLs to absolute ones.
 - When implementing a new pattern, you can set verbose=True inside the class to request that debug information
   is printed out when the pattern gets defined and compiled. The print out includes list of all variables detected 
   and the regex string produced from compilation.
 - Troubleshooting. When the pattern doesn't work, try removing a part of it, say the 2nd half,
   and check if it works in the shorter form. If not, cut it again and again. In this way, you can easily track down
   the place which causes problems.
 - If you need to test regexes, for debugging purposes, check online interactive sites like http://gskinner.com/RegExr/

Dependencies: waxeye 0.8.0, regex 2013-03-11.

This file uses an improved and extended version of 're' module, the 'regex' - see http://pypi.python.org/pypi/regex
This module is used primarily because it provides handling of repeated groups inside regular expressions
- this is needed for extraction of lists of items, to be captured by a single redex variable.
